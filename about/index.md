Ganapati Press is a publisher based in Oxford, UK.

The Publisher is very grateful to the late Professor Lambert and his Ã©quipe for his invaluable advice. For many decades Prof. Lambert conducted a small publishing house specialising in hand-made prints of philological edition of the classics. Without his scholarly advice, the standard of this work would not have been the same.

The main typesetting work has been kindly offered by Ab Academia Aoidon (Paris, Lyon). Many thanks to Mo. Guido Sette (Lyon) for the professional typesetting service.

The Publisher is also grateful to the international team of collaborators that spent countless hours proofreading and checking the current text against the originals.

Our deepest gratitude to Sri Chinmoy. His living presence can be felt breathing throughout his writings. It is such a privilege to be involved with his works, in any form.
